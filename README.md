## Notes:
* For add to cart feature: I would have liked to have included a variant select option to make this a usable feature, but time did not permit. Also, I typically like to use a global cart/mini cart rather than n, but again, time did not permit.
* I added some functionality to product slider to handle window resizing--that is why the images fade in and out on resize. The idea was the mask the transition a bit so it didn't feel so choppy, but it still needs a bit of massaging.
* There are some places I would have liked to leverage snippets--in particular the product card mark-up, but I wasn't sure if I was supposed to add snippets or not. 
* With a bit more time, I might have added some layout controls to the section schema--number of cards, breakpoints, toggle on/off the sale badge display, etc.
* It took me almost the entire 4 hours--just over including this README--to complete. I did unfortunately have to complete the assessment over three separate sittings over the course of the day due to some circumstances outside of my control (hence the single commit), but I was careful to monitor the time spent. 
* I felt very comfortable with the assignment. The only mild blocker was working with FLickity. It was my first time using the library, so it took a bit longer than I expected to get it configured to spec.
